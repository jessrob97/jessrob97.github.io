            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UC Santa Barbara, being advised by Professor Jason Marden and Professor João Hespanha. My research interests are centered on multiagent systems, game theory, distributed optimization, mechanism design, and security, however, I’m genuinely open to new domains of thinking which may challenge my assumptions or deepen my appreciation for that which I already know. On campus, I am an active member of the interdepartmental Center for Control, Dynamical Systems, and Computation (CCDC) and participate regularly in the biannual Southern California Control Workshop (SCCW).
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a proud husband and father of three, and I look forward to having “free time” someday in the distant future. When I do have a spare moment, I enjoy playing sports – really, playing anything that anyone else will play with me – and serving my community.
